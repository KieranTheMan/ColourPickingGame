# ColourPickingGame

#Task:
To build a color game using HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript ES6+.

#Summary:
I chose to develop a simple color game, to improve my knowledge of JavaScript also understanding of Higher order functions and Dom 
manipulation. The main focus was to exercise my current knowledge on Javascript also CSS3.

#Functionally:
The aim of the game is to select the right colour square, matching the colour displayed as an RGB. Once the user has selected the 
correct colour, the display header and all squares will change to the current winning colour also displaying a winning message.

The user also has a choice of selecting a difficulty level from easy or hard.  Easy displays three colored squares to select from and 
hard has six colored squares.

There is also an algorithm that randomizes the squares colors on every new game played, once the ‘new colors’ button or difficulty level has been selected. The random colour algorithm also effects the winning colors that must be chosen to win.

If the user selects the wrong colour a small message is displayed to let them know to try again also the selected colour is automatically coloured grey.

#Design:
This design is simple with space, having the main focus being the coloured squares.
