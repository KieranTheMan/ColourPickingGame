# ColourPickingGame
#Task:
To build a color game using HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript ES6+.

##Summary:
I chose to develop a simple color game, to improve my knowledge of JavaScript also understanding of
Higher order functions and Dom manipulation.  The main focus was to exercise my current knowledge on Javascript also CSS3.

##Functionally:
The aim of the game is to select the right colour square, matching the colour displayed as an RGB.
Once the user has selected the correct colour, the display header and all squares will change to the current winning colour also displaying a winning message.

The user also has a choice of selecting a difficulty level from easy or hard.
Easy displays three colored squares to select from and hard has six colored squares.

There is also an algorithm that randomizes the squares colors on every new game played, 
once the ‘new colors’ button or difficulty level has been selected. 
The random colour algorithm also effects the winning colors that must be chosen to win.

If the user selects the wrong colour a small message is displayed to let them know to try again also the selected colour is automatically coloured grey.

#Design:
This design is simple with space, having the main focus being the coloured squares.

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
